# XVim Logo Usage Guide

- The master source is the EPS file.

- Due to limitations in the SVG format, the gradient-along-path is approximated using slices and linear backgrounds. As such, the SVG colored logo does not match the intended rendering 100%. The black & white versions are for print or other uses.

- Please use the PNG solid variant for avatars (Github, Twitter, Gravatar, etc). Use the rounded corner variant on the Web site or in the README (basically when included as an `<img>` without any additional cropping).

- If you have any questions about the logo, email xvim@reda.fastmail.com or tweet [@kaishin](https://twitter.com/kaishin).
